I developed "Pixel Art Filter," a web application that allows users to upload a photo and obtain a pixelated, retro version of it. The application was built using React, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with a focus on both the frontend and backend development to ensure a seamless user experience and efficient performance.
